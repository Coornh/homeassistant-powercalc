# Smart dimmer

Below are some examples of how to configure a smart switch device in the library.

## Smart switch with relay

```json
{
  "measure_method": "manual",
  "measure_device": "Some device",
  "name": "Some smart switch",
  "standby_power": 0.3,
  "standby_power_on": 0.7,
  "sensor_config": {
    "power_sensor_naming": "{} Device Power",
    "energy_sensor_naming": "{} Device Energy"
  },
  "device_type": "smart_switch",
  "calculation_strategy": "fixed"
}
```

When this profile is discovered, the user will be asked to provide the power consumption of the connected device.
Assuming the user provides a value of 50W the following power values will be calculated:
- ON: 50.7W
- OFF: 0.3W

... note::
    During the configuration flow the user als has the option to toggle `self_usage_included` on or off.
    When toggled on the power when ON will be 50W instead of 50.7W, in the example above.

## Smart switch without relay

Smart switches that can only measure power consumption, but don't have a relay to toggle the power, can be configured as follows:

```json
{
  "measure_method": "manual",
  "measure_device": "Some device",
  "name": "Some smart switch",
  "standby_power": 0.3,
  "sensor_config": {
    "power_sensor_naming": "{} Device Power",
    "energy_sensor_naming": "{} Device Energy"
  },
  "device_type": "smart_switch",
  "calculation_strategy": "fixed",
  "fixed_config": {
    "power": 0.8
  }
}
```

In this scenario, the user will NOT be asked to provide the power consumption of the connected device.

Following the example above, the following power values will be calculated:
- ON: 0.8W
- OFF: 0.3W

## Measure

Start by disconnecting the device from the smart switch, as we need to measure the power consumption of the smart switch itself, not the device it controls.
Next, plug the smart switch into the power meter (smart plug) you will be using for the measurement.

The ability to measure the smart switch's standby power depends on the smart plug you're using. Some plugs may not be able to measure very low values.

The Zhurui PR10 smart plug is a good option, as it can measure power as low as 0.1W.

Alternatively, you can try another smart plug, but you might need to add a dummy load to the smart switch to get an accurate measurement.
When using a smart plug, you can use the [measure utility](../../contributing/measure.md) and select the `average` mode for 1 minute to get a reading.

Now, youâ€™re ready to measure the smart switch's power consumption in both the `ON` and `OFF` states.

- Turn the switch ON in HA
- Record the power reading
- Turn the switch OFF in HA
- Record the power reading

Choose the appropriate example JSON for your situation and replace the values with the ones you've measured.
